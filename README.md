# Manual Exploitation Development For TVT NVMS 1000 suffers from a directory traversal tag vulnerability

## What is a directory traversal exploit?
The directory traversal/path traversal attack (also known as dot dot slash attack) is an HTTP
exploit that allows an attacker to access restricted files, directories and commands that reside
outside the web server’s root directory. Directory traversal attacks are executed through web
browsers. An attacker may manipulate a URL in such way that the website will reveal the
confined files on the web server.

This type of exploit owes its name to the fact that the attacker uses special-character
“../”sequence to escape web document root, or alternate encodings of the “../” sequence to
bypass security filters and access files or directories that reside outside the root directory.
The attackers can modify critical files such as programs or libraries, download password files,
expose source code of the web application, or execute powerful commands on the web server,
which can lead to complete compromise of the web server.

Consider a shopping application that displays images of items for sale. Images are loaded via
some HTML like the following:
```
<img src="/loadImage?filename=218.png">
```

The **loadImage** URL takes a **filename** parameter and returns the contents of the specified
file. The image files themselves are stored on disk in the location /var/www/images/. To
return an image, the application appends the requested filename to this base directory and uses
a filesystem API to read the contents of the file. In the above case, the application reads from
the following file path:
```
/var/www/images/218.png
```

The application implements no defenses against directory traversal attacks, so an attacker can
request the following URL to retrieve an arbitrary file from the server's filesystem:
```
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=../../../etc/passwd
```

This causes the application to read from the following file path
```
/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd
```

The sequence ../ is valid within a file path, and means to step up one level in the directory
structure. The three consecutive ../ sequences step up from */var/www/images/* to the
filesystem root, and so the file that is actually read is:
```
/etc/passwd
```

On Unix-based operating systems, this is a standard file containing details of the users that are
registered on the server.

On Windows, both ../ and ..\ are valid directory traversal sequences, and an equivalent attack to
retrieve a standard operating system file would be:
```
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=..\..\..\windows\win.ini
```

## Common obstacles to exploiting file path traversal vulnerabilities
Many applications that place user input into file paths implement some kind of defense against
path traversal attacks, and these can often be circumvented.

If an application strips or blocks directory traversal sequences from the user-supplied filename,
then it might be possible to bypass the defense using a variety of techniques.

You might be able to use an absolute path from the filesystem root, such
as filename=/etc/passwd, to directly reference a file without using any traversal sequences.
